This fork is identical to https://github.com/cryptomator/aur-bin but it just enables otlined try icons which are visible on both a light and a dark background.
Feel free to use it, but thake into account that this minimal modification was done for my personal use and I take no responsibility if something goes wrong with your system or your files while using it.

Have fun!

p.s. currently trying to upload this to AUR.
